        <p>Day 1 of the festival started with many artists lined-up for a spectacular performance at different stages across the festival venue
          With the massive mainstage design the fans anf the attendees of the festival were in for a treat.<br>
          Due to the pandemic the festival never took place for 2 years, but now it is back in 2022 with a bang.<br>
          With insane production of the stage with lasers, Pyros & strobes it was surely to light up the sky when darkness fall.<br>
          Day 1 came to an end with a segment they call Spotlight. This year SUB-ZERO PROJECT were the ones closing the day 1 and the spotlight.
